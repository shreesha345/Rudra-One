  Modify an existing SigNoz dashboard — add or remove panels, edit a
  panel's query, threshold, or unit, rename the dashboard, change a
  panel type (graph ↔ table ↔ value), rearrange the layout, add or edit
  variables, or update tags. Make sure to use this skill whenever the
  user says "add a panel to my dashboard", "change the query on this
  panel", "remove the latency widget", "rename my dashboard", "update
  the filters", "rearrange the layout", "add a variable", "change panel
  type from graph to table", or otherwise asks to change something on a
  dashboard that already exists — even if they don't say "modify" or
  "edit" explicitly.

# Dashboard Modify

## Prerequisites

This skill calls SigNoz MCP server tools (`signoz_get_dashboard`,
`signoz_update_dashboard`, `signoz_list_dashboards`, `signoz_list_metrics`,
`signoz_get_field_keys`, `signoz_get_field_values`,
`signoz_execute_builder_query`).
Before running the workflow, confirm the `signoz_*` tools are available.
If they are not, the SigNoz MCP server is not installed or configured —
run `signoz-mcp-setup` first to initialize or repair the MCP connection. Do not
fall back to raw HTTP calls or hand-edit dashboard JSON without the MCP tools.

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- Add, remove, or edit panels/widgets on an existing dashboard
- Change a panel's query, title, type, or display settings
- Add, remove, or edit dashboard variables
- Rename or re-describe a dashboard
- Rearrange panel layout or resize panels
- Change a panel type (e.g., graph to table, value to graph)
- Add or modify thresholds on a panel
- Update tags on a dashboard

Do NOT use when:
- User wants to understand what a dashboard shows → `signoz-explaining-dashboards`
- User wants to create a new dashboard → `signoz-creating-dashboards`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the target dashboard

Use a UUID supplied directly or by dashboard resource context. A name is not an
ID: resolve every name-only request with `signoz_list_dashboards`, paginating via
`pagination.nextOffset` while `pagination.hasMore` is true. If multiple dashboards
match, present them and ask which one to modify; if one matches, use its UUID.

### Step 2: Fetch the current dashboard state

Call `signoz_get_dashboard` with the dashboard UUID to retrieve its full
configuration. This is **mandatory** — `signoz_update_dashboard` requires the
complete post-update state, not a partial patch. Never skip this step.

Examine the response to understand:
- Current widgets and their IDs
- Current layout positions (x, y, w, h in the 12-column grid)
- Current variables
- Current queries on each panel
- The `panelMap` structure (row-to-child mappings)

### Step 3: Plan the modification

Based on the user's request, plan the changes.

**Confirm with the user before applying if:**
- The modification is **destructive** — removing panels, deleting variables,
  replacing an entire query with a different one, changing a panel's `dataSource`
  (e.g., traces → logs), or fundamentally altering what data is shown (changing
  aggregation from p99 to avg, removing groupBy dimensions)
- The request is **ambiguous** — multiple panels could match "the latency panel"
- The change is **large** — restructuring sections, adding many panels at once

**Destructive means data loss or silent behavior change.** Even if the user says
"just do it quickly," a brief confirmation ("I'll remove 'Memory Fragmentation'
permanently — OK?") takes seconds and prevents irreversible mistakes. User urgency
does not override this guardrail.

**Non-destructive changes need no destructive confirmation:** renaming, adding a
panel or variable, changing a unit or panel type, adjusting layout, and adding
thresholds. Variable additions still require the panel-applicability prompt below.

**Compound modifications:** When a request involves multiple changes (e.g., remove a
panel + add a panel + rename), plan all changes against the fetched state and apply
them as a single update. Do not apply and re-fetch between changes.

### Step 4: Apply the modification

Merge the planned changes into the full dashboard JSON from Step 2.

**Modification rules:**

- **Preserve supported mutable state.** Copy the fetched dashboard, change only
  what the user requested, and compare semantics after MCP normalization. Do not
  drop unrelated widgets, variables, layout items, or panelMap entries.

- **Read schemas before every update.** Read all required and applicable
  conditional resources named by `signoz_update_dashboard`. For Query Builder,
  also read `signoz://metrics-aggregation-guide`,
  `signoz://traces/query-builder-guide`, or
  `signoz://logs/query-builder-guide` for the signal. MCP is the source of truth.

- **Adding a panel:**
  1. Build the widget from `signoz://dashboard/widgets-examples`, with a UUID for
     its `id`.
  2. Detect rows from `widgets[].panelTypes == "row"`. Unless side-by-side
     placement is explicit, append at `x: 0`, `y: max(y + h)` only when rowless
     or targeting the final row. For an earlier row, insert the widget and layout
     before the next row at `x: 0`, `y: <next row's old y>` (the target row's
     current bottom), then shift that row and all later top-level and `panelMap`
     `y` positions down by the new panel's height.
  3. Add a layout entry whose `i` matches the widget ID and obeys the bounds below.
     If rows exist, add it to the intended row's `panelMap[rowId].widgets`,
     creating that entry when absent. An empty `panelMap` does not prove the
     dashboard is rowless.
  4. All modified panels are validated below as a hard requirement —
     see the "Dry-run modified panels" step before
     `signoz_update_dashboard` and the "Mandatory dry-run
     before update" guardrail. Author the saved query semantics first, then use
     the lossless dry-run translation below.

- **Removing a panel:** Remove the widget from `widgets`, its entry from `layout`,
  and its entry from the parent row's `panelMap.widgets` (if it exists in panelMap).
  **Do not** try to auto-compact or shift `y` positions of remaining panels — the
  SigNoz frontend grid engine handles gap-closing automatically. Simply remove the
  three references (widget, layout, panelMap entry) and leave all other positions
  unchanged.

- **Editing a panel's query:** Replace the query object on the target widget. Keep
  all other widget fields intact. If the user is changing *what* the panel
  measures (not just renaming a label), the new query is validated by the
  mandatory dry-run step below (and the "Mandatory dry-run before update"
  guardrail) — replacing a working query with a broken one is a destructive
  change the user will only notice after the panel goes empty.

- **Changing panel type:** Update `panelTypes` and handle type-specific fields:
  follow the target type's complete shape in `widgets-examples`. Preserve the
  existing query and data source; change only visualization-specific fields.

- **Adding/editing variables:**
  1. For ambiguous or version-sensitive attributes, call `signoz_get_field_keys`
     and optionally `signoz_get_field_values` with the relevant signal and
     `fieldContext=resource`. Trust the discovered key (for example,
     `deployment.environment` versus `deployment.environment.name`).
  2. Show the panel list and ask whether the variable applies to all panels or a
     selected subset.
  3. Use a DYNAMIC variable for an attribute-backed dropdown, with a UUID `id`.
     Keep its human-readable variables-map key and `name` identical.
  4. Add `$<key>` only to the selected panel filters, preserve unselected panels,
     and dry-run every query changed by the variable.

- **Rearranging layout / side-by-side placement:**
  - SigNoz uses a **12-column grid**, never 24: every entry must satisfy
    `0 <= x < 12`, `1 <= w <= 12`, and `x + w <= 12`.
  - Two panels side-by-side: each gets `w: 6`, first at `x: 0`, second at `x: 6`,
    same `y` and `h`.
  - Three panels in a row: `w: 4` at `x: 0`, `x: 4`, `x: 8`.
  - When resizing an existing panel to make room, update its `w` and `x`, then
    place the new panel in the freed space at the same `y`.
  - Common heights: `h: 6` for graphs/tables, `h: 2`–`h: 3` for value panels,
    `h: 1` for row headers.
  - **Keep panelMap in sync**: whenever you change `x`, `y`, `w`, or `h` in the
    top-level `layout` array, apply the same change to the matching entry in
    `panelMap[rowId].widgets`. These are duplicated and must stay consistent.

**Dry-run modified panels (mandatory).** Before `signoz_update_dashboard`, call
`signoz_execute_builder_query` for each modified query-bearing panel. Build its
complete payload from the current tool schema; do not pass widget JSON. Translate
the active Builder, PromQL, or ClickHouse query losslessly into its matching
envelope, preserving every semantic field and query name (`A`, `B`, `F1`, etc.).
Supply representative values for referenced dashboard variables. A server error
or unexpected empty result must be fixed before update, unless the user explicitly
accepted confirmed missing telemetry.

Call `signoz_update_dashboard` with the dashboard UUID and the **complete** modified
dashboard JSON.

### Step 5: Report the result

Briefly tell the user what was changed. Offer further modifications if relevant.

## Guardrails

- **Full state on update**: `signoz_update_dashboard` requires the complete
  dashboard JSON (not a partial patch). Always call `signoz_get_dashboard` first
  to get the current state, merge your changes into that full object, and pass
  the result to `signoz_update_dashboard`. Never construct an update payload from
  scratch.
- **Preserve what you don't change**: Preserve supported mutable semantics for
  widgets, variables, layout, and panelMap outside the request. Diff-and-merge;
  do not rebuild or promise byte-for-byte equality after MCP normalization.
- **Confirm destructive changes**: Before removing panels, replacing queries, or
  deleting variables, confirm with the user — even if they say "just do it" or
  express urgency. Additions, renames, type changes, and variable additions do not
  need confirmation.
- **Mandatory dry-run before update.** For every added or edited
  query-bearing panel, run `signoz_execute_builder_query`
  before `signoz_update_dashboard` (envelope translation in
  the Dry-run step above). Row / header panels (`panelTypes:
  "row"`) have no query — validate their shape against
  `signoz://dashboard/widgets-examples` instead. Modifications are
  especially prone to silent regression because the panel worked
  before the edit — a saved empty panel from a typo'd rename or
  attribute swap is the worst failure mode for this skill.
- **Valid JSON only**: Follow the v5 schema documented in the
  `signoz://dashboard/*` MCP resources (`instructions`, `widgets-instructions`,
  `widgets-examples`, `query-builder-example`). Never generate malformed queries
  or layouts.
- **OTel attribute names**: Use `service.name` not `service` and `host.name` not
  `host`, but discover version-sensitive keys such as `deployment.environment`
  versus `deployment.environment.name` instead of forcing one form.
- **No metric guessing**: If adding or changing queries and you are not sure what
  metrics are available, ask the user or call `signoz_list_metrics` to discover
  available metrics. Wrong metric names produce empty panels.
- **Paginate dashboard listing**: When searching for a dashboard by name, always
  paginate through all pages of `signoz_list_dashboards` before concluding a
  dashboard does not exist.
- **Identifiers**: Use UUIDs for new widget and variable IDs. Reuse the widget ID
  as `layout.i`; keep each variable map key identical to its human-readable `name`,
  and keep query names such as `A`, `B`, and `F1` stable.
- **Scope boundary**: This skill modifies existing dashboards. Hand new-dashboard
  requests to `signoz-creating-dashboards`.

## Examples

**User:** "Add an error rate panel to my Redis dashboard"

**Agent:**
1. Calls `signoz_list_dashboards` (paginates all pages) — finds "Redis Overview"
   dashboard with UUID `abc-123`.
2. Calls `signoz_get_dashboard` with UUID `abc-123` — gets full configuration with
   8 existing panels.
3. Calls `signoz_list_metrics` to find available Redis error metrics.
4. Creates a new graph widget (with UUID, all required fields, and a formula query
   for error rate), appends it below the current layout, and adds it to the
   appropriate row's `panelMap`.
5. Dry-runs the new panel with `signoz_execute_builder_query`; fixes any error or
   unexpected empty result.
6. Calls `signoz_update_dashboard` with the full modified JSON (all 9 panels).
7. Reports: "Added an 'Error Rate' graph panel to your Redis Overview dashboard
   under the Overview section. Want me to adjust anything?"

---

**User:** "Change the latency panel from a graph to a table on my API dashboard"

**Agent:**
1. Resolves "API Monitoring" through paginated `signoz_list_dashboards`, then calls
   `signoz_get_dashboard` with its UUID.
2. Finds the panel titled "Request Latency" — if multiple panels could match,
   confirms with user: "I found 'Request Latency'. Convert that one to a table?"
3. Changes `panelTypes` from `"graph"` to `"table"`, matches the table shape in
   `widgets-examples`, and keeps the query intact.
4. Calls `signoz_update_dashboard` with the full modified JSON (all panels
   preserved).
5. Reports: "Changed 'Request Latency' from a graph to a table. Want me to adjust
   column widths or add column units?"

---

**User:** "Remove the CPU panel and rename the dashboard to 'Service Health'"

**Agent:**
1. Fetches the dashboard via `signoz_get_dashboard`.
2. Finds the "CPU Usage" panel. Confirms: "I'll remove the 'CPU Usage' panel and
   rename the dashboard to 'Service Health'. Proceed?" (Removal is destructive —
   always confirm.)
3. User confirms.
4. Removes the widget from `widgets`, its layout entry, and its panelMap reference.
   Leaves all other panel positions unchanged (the frontend grid closes gaps
   automatically). Updates `title` to "Service Health".
5. Calls `signoz_update_dashboard` with the full modified JSON.
6. Reports: "Removed the 'CPU Usage' panel and renamed the dashboard to 'Service
   Health'. Anything else to adjust?"
