# Setting Up Observability After Ingestion

Take a service from "telemetry is flowing into SigNoz" to "I have a
dashboard, alerts, saved views, and a tuning loop." This skill is an
**orchestration layer, not a standalone reference** — the mechanical
work lives in the sibling SigNoz skills and the MCP tools/resources hold
the current payload schemas. This skill sequences them and supplies the
judgment calls (scope, SLOs, thresholds, what to skip) that no single
skill owns; it deliberately does not restate payload schemas or field
rules, so read the relevant `signoz://…` resource before composing any
payload.

Use this when traces, logs, or metrics are **already landing** in
SigNoz and you want an opinionated, SLO-aware setup — not when you're
still wiring up the SDK. Audience: two consumers — an autonomous AI SRE
agent that runs without a human in the loop (e.g. an in-product SigNoz
assistant), and an engineer at a Claude Code / Codex / Cursor prompt.
Both follow the same flow; where a step needs a human decision (Phase 1
triage, Phase 5 sign-off), the host decides how to surface it, and an
autonomous host fills the gap from upstream context instead of blocking.

## Prerequisites

This skill calls SigNoz MCP server tools (`signoz_list_services`,
`signoz_list_dashboards`, `signoz_get_field_keys`,
`signoz_execute_builder_query`, `signoz_create_dashboard`,
`signoz_create_alert`, `signoz_create_view`, etc.) and
delegates to sibling skills. Before running the workflow, confirm the
`signoz_*` tools are available. If they are not, the SigNoz MCP
server is not installed or configured — run `signoz-mcp-setup` first. Do
not fall back to raw HTTP calls or fabricate payloads.

## When to use

Use this skill when the user wants the **whole post-ingestion setup**:
SLI/SLO → exploration → dashboard → views → alerts → tuning, in any
combination of those deliverables, sequenced as one workflow.

Do NOT use this skill when the user wants a single artifact — hand off
directly:
- Just a dashboard → `signoz-creating-dashboards`.
- Just one static / threshold alert or notification rule →
  `signoz-creating-alerts`. (But SLO / burn-rate / error-budget
  alerting — even with no dashboard — stays *here*: it needs the SLI/SLO
  capture and burn-rate judgment in the phases below.)
- Just a saved Explorer view → `signoz-managing-views`.
- A one-off exploratory query → `signoz-generating-queries`.
- A concept/doc lookup (SRE methods, OTel conventions, burn-rate math)
  → `signoz-searching-docs` / `signoz_search_docs`.

Each phase below points to the skill that does the mechanical work; this
skill owns the order and the decisions.

## Phase 1 — Triage scope (don't skip)

Before touching any tools, get these answers. Each unblocks a downstream
phase.

1. **What does this service do, and does it call external services?**
   One or two sentences. This shapes the SLI (what "working" means) and
   flags downstream dependencies worth monitoring — if it calls a DB,
   cache, queue, or third-party API, plan to watch the client-span
   latency and error rate to each dependency, since a healthy service
   fronting a sick dependency still fails users.
2. **What deliverables?** dashboard / alerts / saved views — any
   combination.
3. **Infra monitoring too? (optional — ask)** If the service runs on
   infra you own (k8s pods, VMs, containers) shipping telemetry under
   the same resource attributes, you can add USE/infra panels (CPU,
   memory, restarts, network) with no extra instrumentation — see Phase
   3. Skip if a platform team already owns the host/cluster dashboard.
4. **Which signals are emitted?** traces / logs / metrics. Drives which
   `signoz_get_field_keys` calls you make.
5. **What's the canonical resource filter?** Usually `service.name`.
   Confirm the exact value before querying — don't guess.
6. **What does success look like for users of this service?** (Sets up
   Phase 2.) Even a one-line answer ("requests under 1s with no 5xx") is
   enough — it becomes the SLI.
7. **Who owns it, and is there a runbook?** Owning team, service tier,
   and the prod/staging scope — these become alert labels and
   annotations in Phase 8. Capture a real runbook URL if one exists;
   never invent one.

Offer "explore data first" as an explicit option.

## Phase 1.5 — Inventory what already exists

Each create sub-skill runs its own rigorous duplicate-check when invoked
(`signoz-creating-dashboards` lists dashboards; `signoz-creating-alerts`
paginates alert rules) — don't re-implement that here. The orchestration
value is a single up-front sweep so you *sequence around* what exists
instead of hitting collisions mid-build:

- **Is the service reporting, and under what exact name?**
  (`signoz_list_services`.) This name is the resource filter every
  later phase reuses — pin it before anything else.
- **Does a dashboard / alert / saved view already exist for it?** If so,
  plan to **extend** it — route to `signoz-modifying-dashboards`,
  `signoz-managing-views`, or `signoz_update_alert` — rather than
  standing up a parallel one. `signoz-explaining-dashboards` /
  `signoz-explaining-alerts` summarize anything you're inheriting.
- **Is there a notification channel to reuse?** (Carried into Phase 5.)

Learn just enough to decide extend-vs-create per artifact; leave the
exhaustive listing to the sub-skills.

## Phase 2 — Capture the SLI/SLO before designing anything

This is the gating artifact. Without it, alerts become "the metric
crossed a line" instead of "the user-visible error budget is being burnt
fast enough to matter."

Collect:
- **SLI formula** — `good events / valid events`. E.g. *successful
  checkout requests / total checkout requests* (excluding health checks,
  synthetic probes, scanner traffic, and non-user long-poll endpoints).
- **SLO target** — e.g. 99.5% over a 30-day rolling window.
- **Exclusions** — what doesn't count as a valid event (synthetic
  probes, scanner traffic, streaming endpoints).
- **Error budget remaining** — derived from target. Drives burn-rate
  alert math.

Carry these forward — they feed Phase 8 directly. (SLO/burn-rate
background: `signoz-searching-docs`.)

## Phase 3 — Explore what's actually there (RED + USE coverage)

`signoz-generating-queries` owns the exploration itself — the
discover-before-querying rule, every discovery call
(`signoz_list_metrics`, `signoz_get_field_keys`,
`signoz_get_field_values`,
`signoz_get_service_top_operations`), tool choice, and the
no-data distinction. Drive it to inventory the data; don't restate its
query mechanics here. (`signoz-searching-docs` covers the RED/USE methods
and SigNoz field semantics if you need a refresher.)

The orchestration job is to map what it finds onto **RED** (Request
rate, Errors, Duration) and **USE** (Utilization, Saturation, Errors),
spot the gaps, and make the judgment calls generating-queries doesn't:

**Coverage checklist** (RED for services, USE for infra/resources):

- [ ] **R**ate — request/call rate per operation
- [ ] **E**rrors — error count or rate per operation
- [ ] **D**uration — p50/p95/p99 latency from spans or histograms
- [ ] **U**tilization — CPU, memory, disk, queue depth, pool occupancy (only if you own the infra)
- [ ] **S**aturation — request queue, GC pause, connection pool wait
- [ ] **E**rrors at the resource layer — disk failures, evictions, OOM kills

A missing signal (e.g. no error count) is an **instrumentation gap** —
flag it before building around what's there.

**Span metrics back alerts, not just panels.** When generating-queries
surfaces SigNoz's trace→metrics output (`signoz_calls_total`,
`signoz_latency_*`, DB/external-call span metrics), prefer it as the RED
source for *both* the dashboard and the burn-rate alerts: it's
pre-aggregated and cheap, whereas raw trace aggregation over a long alert
window is expensive and an unstable alert source. (Confirm exact
metric/label names via discovery — don't hardcode.)

**Render any counter by the volume you just measured, not by reflex.**
Not throughput-specific — it applies to every counter you'll graph
(request rate, **error counts**, restarts, OOM kills, evictions), and
low-volume errors and resource-layer events are the usual victims, not
just requests. Per-second rate suits steady high-volume signals; where
Phase 3 shows the count is low, bursty, or human-paced, a `/sec` graph
renders as unreadable tiny decimals (`0.03/s`). Use the *symptom*, not a
hard threshold: if per-second shows as fractions, pass that to Phase 6
as intent — render a per-interval **increase** count over a wider window
(24h–7d), not a rate. (Gauges — CPU, memory, queue depth — are already
absolute; this is a counter concern.) It's a deliberate tradeoff
(`increase` rescales its y-axis with the selected range), so make it a
conscious call, never a blanket default either way.
`signoz-creating-dashboards` owns the rate-vs-increase mechanic.

**Verify the infra→service join (the USE half).** Don't assume
`service.name` is present on host/container/k8s metrics — they often
carry only `host.name` / `k8s.pod.name` / `k8s.node.name`, and
`k8s.deployment.name` may differ from `service.name`. Have
generating-queries confirm which identity attribute actually joins the
infra metric to this workload, then scope USE panels by that *confirmed*
attribute. If nothing joins, ask the user for the workload selector
rather than guessing.

**Discover downstream topology from traces, not the human's memory**
(Phase 1 Q1). The gotcha worth carrying: client spans are
`kind_string = 'Client'` in the SigNoz v5 schema — *not* `kind`, *not*
`SPAN_KIND_CLIENT` — so verify the field/value, then group by the
populated dependency attribute (`external_http_url` / `http_host` for
HTTP, `db_name` / `db_operation` for databases) to surface every
downstream the service actually calls, including ones the human forgot.

**Multi-tenant note** — if the service serves multiple tenants/regions,
look for a stable non-PII tenant/region attribute (e.g. `tenant.id`,
`region`, `deployment.environment`) — avoid raw URLs or user
identifiers. Per-tenant breakdowns belong on the dashboard;
aggregate-only views hide single-tenant outages.

**SLI hygiene** — confirm the events your SLI counts carry the right
labels. For a broad denominator ("all requests to the service"), scanner
traffic on `/.env*`, `/.git*` is real but should be **excluded** — it's
not user traffic. The exclusion predicate should *only subtract scanners*
and stay neutral otherwise, so use the **bare** negation —
`<url_or_route_field> NOT REGEXP '/\\.(env|git|aws|ssh|well-known)'` —
**not** `EXISTS AND …`. SigNoz negative operators also match rows where
the field is *absent*, so fieldless valid events (non-HTTP spans,
internal ops) stay counted; let the SLI's own scope filter
(`service.name`, `http.route`) define the event universe, not the
scanner predicate. (Pair `EXISTS` with a negation only for the *opposite*
intent — excluding a specific value among rows that have the field, e.g.
`service.name EXISTS AND service.name != 'redis'`.) A well-scoped SLI
already excludes scanner paths, so this mainly bites service-wide ratios.
Keep a separate security view if you care about scanners.

## Phase 4 — Classify labels by cardinality and cost

Before wiring labels into queries, classify each. Wrong classification
is the #1 source of metric-bill explosions and dashboard unreadability.

| Class | Cardinality | Where it goes |
|---|---|---|
| Routing | <20 | Alert label, inhibition rule, notification policy (e.g. `severity`, `team`) |
| Variable | <100, human-readable | Dashboard variable (e.g. `environment`, `tenant`) |
| Breakdown | <500 typically | groupBy on graphs / tables (e.g. `gen_ai.tool.name`) |
| Trace/log-only | Unbounded | Only on traces or logs — never on metric series |

Never let raw URLs, query strings, user IDs, session IDs, or request IDs
end up as metric labels — they explode cardinality and the bill. Those
belong on traces/logs.

Cardinality matters more for *cost* than for *display performance* —
SigNoz/ClickHouse handles 100s of variable values fine; the limit is
human readability of the dropdown.

## Phase 5 — Confirm channels, burn-rate windows, recovery thresholds

Lock in before creating alerts:

1. **Notification routing.** Decide *which* channel each severity tier
   routes to (e.g. critical → PagerDuty, warning → Slack). Reuse an
   existing channel from `signoz_list_notification_channels` where
   one fits; never invent a name. The actual channel resolution/creation
   and secret handling are owned by `signoz-creating-alerts` (Phase 8) —
   here you only lock the tier→channel mapping.
2. **Burn-rate windows.** Common starting points for a 99.9% SLO over a
   30-day budget:

   | Severity | Burn rate | Long window | Short window | Routing |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Page-now critical | 14.4× | 1h | 5m | PagerDuty |
   | Slow burn warning | 6× | 6h | 30m | Slack |
   | Ticket-level low | 1× | 3d | 6h | Ticket queue |

   The burn-rate multipliers are SLO-independent — for a different
   target, compute each absolute threshold inline as
   `error-rate = burn rate × (1 − SLO)` (e.g. 14.4× → 1.44% at 99.9%).
   `signoz-searching-docs` explains the burn-rate *method*; it can't
   compute your numbers.

   Both windows must trip simultaneously for the alert to fire: the long
   window suppresses brief spikes; the short window gives fast recovery
   so a resolved incident stops paging quickly. (The 6× row is a page in
   the canonical SRE table — routing it to Slack here is a deliberate
   severity downgrade; adjust to your on-call norms.)
3. **Recovery thresholds** (hysteresis). Decide that every numeric alert
   recovers *below* its firing target (e.g. fire at 80%, recover at 70%)
   to prevent boundary flapping — `signoz-creating-alerts` carries this
   into the `recoveryTarget` field.

Surface these as a clarification with concrete proposed values, using
the host application's question/UI mechanism (a structured clarification
tool, inline tags, an interactive prompt — follow the host's rules).
Never ask open-ended "what threshold do you want?" — propose, let the
user adjust.
Get explicit sign-off on scope and thresholds before building. Flag
baselines that affect thresholds ("current error rate is 5.1%, so a
static 5% alert will be noisy — proposing a burn-rate alert instead").

## Phase 6 — Build the dashboard(s)

Hand off to `signoz-creating-dashboards` — it owns templates, the
layout/variable/OTel-naming defaults, the v5 schema and its gotchas, the
no-data probe, and the mandatory per-panel dry-run (`signoz-modifying-dashboards`
for later edits). Do **not** restate panel JSON or grid mechanics here;
pass intent and let that skill build.

**Prefer several focused dashboards over one large one.** Since
`signoz-creating-dashboards` builds one dashboard per call — and its
template catalog is already organized per technology — the orchestration
decision is *which set of boards to compose*. Default to splitting by
category/audience and invoking the sub-skill once per board:

- **Service / RED (APM):** KPI tiles + request rate, errors,
  p50/p95/p99. The primary on-call board.
- **Infra / USE:** CPU, memory, restarts, network — only if infra
  monitoring was opted into (Phase 1 Q3), scoped by the attribute
  *confirmed* in Phase 3. Usually a stock template (`hostmetrics`,
  `k8s`) imported as its own board.
- **Downstream dependencies:** client-span p99 + error rate per
  dependency — only if the service has external deps (Phase 1 Q1),
  grouped by the attribute found in Phase 3 (`external_http_url` /
  `db_name`).
- **Business / SLO:** the SLI ratio and error budget, with a per-tenant
  breakdown if multi-tenant (Phase 3) — aggregate-only panels hide
  single-tenant outages.

Splitting keeps each board fast, single-purpose, and ownable by the
right audience (SRE vs app dev vs platform). **Collapse into one board
only when the split would otherwise yield several near-empty ones** — a
small service's handful of panels reads better as rows on one board than
as four 2-panel dashboards. Each board still passes the Phase 1.5
extend-vs-create check, so you reuse an existing board rather than adding
a parallel one.

**Quality bar (every board you create):** production config for a 3am
responder — each panel earns a "what to watch for" description and a
drill-down, and each dashboard earns a top-of-page "start here". Pass
this as intent so `signoz-creating-dashboards` applies it.

## Phase 7 — Saved Explorer views

Hand off to `signoz-managing-views` for the create mechanics (it owns
the view payload and the `extraData`/`selectColumns` shape). The
orchestration value is *which* views to stand up — cheaper than panels
and high-leverage mid-incident:

- ERROR/FATAL logs for the service.
- API request list — the Traces *list* view over server spans
  (`kind_string = 'Server'`, verify per Phase 3): a per-request table
  surfacing service / operation (or `http.route`) /
  `http.response.status_code` / duration / `trace_id`. The fastest "what
  are my endpoints doing right now" surface — sortable by latency or
  status, one click to the full trace, and the broad view that the
  failing/slow-span views below are just filtered subsets of.
- Failing spans for the canonical operation (`has_error = true`).
- Slow spans (`duration_nano > <threshold>`).
- Failed sub-flows (e.g. OAuth requests with errors).
- Correlation drill-downs — error logs carrying `trace_id` (a log spike
  jumps straight to the trace) and slow/error traces that link back to
  their logs.

Two cross-phase constraints to pass along: every view carries the same
environment/tenant filter as the dashboard (so `prod` and `staging` rows
never mix), and the selected columns pass the same PII / no-identifiers
gate as Phase 4.

## Phase 8 — Alerts

`signoz-creating-alerts` owns every per-alert mechanic — channel
resolution (create-first with a test message, name-not-UUID, secret
handling), severity defaults, `op`/`matchType`, units, annotations,
`evalWindow`/`recoveryTarget`, anomaly-rule shape, and the mandatory
dry-run. Drive it once per alert and don't restate any of that here.
(`signoz-explaining-alerts` reads a rule back; `signoz-investigating-alerts`
does RCA once one fires.)

What this orchestration layer adds on top of that skill:

- **SLI-bound alerts are burn-rate pairs, not static thresholds.** A
  static threshold on a ratio flaps; the burn-rate pair is the default
  for anything tied to the Phase 2 SLO.
- **The burn-rate recipe** (the one thing `signoz-creating-alerts`
  can't derive without the SLO). Hand it the *inputs*, not a rule shape:
  the bad/total event definition (prefer the Phase-3 `signoz_calls_total`
  error/total split over raw trace aggregation), the long+short window
  lengths from Phase 5, and the firing target `burnRate × (1 − SLO)`.
  Two judgment calls travel with those inputs — the long and short
  windows must be evaluated as **one rule that ANDs both** (two
  independent rules page on every short spike; if the SigNoz version
  can't express the short-window confirmation in a single rule, ship the
  long window alone and *say so*), and if no clean bad/total split
  exists in the ingested data, burn-rate isn't buildable yet — fall back
  to a baseline-tuned threshold rather than emit a broken rule. Let
  `signoz-creating-alerts` + `signoz://alert/*` pick the
  version-correct rule shape. Note that creating-alerts' "would have
  fired N times in the last 1h" calibration can't grade a 6h/3d
  burn-rate window — don't read a "fired 0 times" there as tuned; the
  Phase 9 re-tune-after-a-week loop is the real calibration.
- **Burn-rate only covers ratio SLIs — schedule the non-ratio failure
  modes too.** A service that stops emitting, or whose traffic
  collapses, never burns error budget (the SLI ratio is undefined at
  zero volume), so the burn-rate pair pages no one. A complete setup
  adds a telemetry-presence / absent-data alert on the primary signal,
  and treats traffic/throughput as its own signal. Hand these intents
  to `signoz-creating-alerts` — it owns the rule shape (absent-data,
  anomaly, threshold) and the healthy-zero handling; the orchestration
  decision is only that they belong in the package.
- **Batch + sequence.** Resolve/confirm the channel (Phase 5 mapping)
  before any rule references it, then create the alerts as a batch
  grouped by routing tier — not one rule per metric.
- **Manual-TODO boundary.** Inhibition rules, org-level notification
  policies (`usePolicy: true` only *opts into* one), and maintenance
  windows are configured in the SigNoz UI / Terraform — these tools
  don't create them. Flag as TODO; never report them done.

## Phase 9 — Hand off

Hand back to the human:
- Dashboard ID(s), view IDs, alert IDs. Don't synthesize frontend URLs —
  return IDs and let the UI resolve them.
- Open questions you couldn't resolve — hand them over as explicit
  TODOs.
- Baselines that may need tuning (e.g. "tool error rate is 5.1% today;
  burn-rate alert tuned for 99% SLO will fire occasionally — re-tune
  after a week of data").

## What to avoid

- **Inventing channel names or webhook URLs.** Ask.
- **Static thresholds for SLI-bound alerts.** Burn-rate pairs are the
  modern default; static thresholds for ratios produce flap.
- **Wrong-sizing dashboards.** Don't cram 18 panels where 12 will do,
  and don't scatter four 2-panel boards where one would read better —
  split by category, then right-size each. Sprawl cuts both ways.
- **Skipping dry-runs to save time.** A 500 at create time is harder to
  debug than at dry-run time.
- **One alert per metric.** Group by routing tier, not per-metric.
- **High-cardinality labels on metric series.** They detonate the bill.
  Move to traces/logs.
- **Synthesizing frontend URLs.** Tools return IDs. Return IDs.
- **Including scanner traffic in SLI denominators.** Real but
  irrelevant. Exclude.
- **Treating exploration findings as throwaway.** Baselines,
  cardinalities, and error counts set your thresholds and tuning
  baseline — don't drop them. Persist them where they survive *any*
  host: bake the numbers into the artifacts (panel/dashboard
  descriptions, alert annotations) and the Phase 9 hand-off, all of
  which live in SigNoz. Don't rely on a local notes file.
- **Letting AI-written instrumentation ship unaudited.** Spot-check what
  is actually emitted before designing dashboards around it.
